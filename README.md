Odin Project assignment: Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and focuses on practicing fundamental HTML skills.

The goal is to build a very basic recipe website consisting of a main index page and multiple recipe pages. At this stage, the emphasis is on correct HTML structure, proper use of elements (headings, links, lists, images), and organizing files and folders — not on design or styling.
